    "WebService::Images::IMGSpot" uploads a file to
    <http://www.imgspot.com/> for you, as long as the file is not bigger
    than 650 Kb, and the format is .JPG, .JPEG, .GIF, and .PNG.

  METHODS
   new
    "new" creates a new WebService::Images::IMGSpot object.

   options
    user_agent
        Returns or sets the LWP::UserAgent object used internally so that it
        can the customised.

   upload
    This method takes either a scalar (like Image::ImageShack) or a hashref
    (like WebService::Images::Nofrag). It will do some basic checking and
    croaks where it sees fit ;-)

    The method returns the URL of where your image is hosted.

   url
    "url" is a method that can be called after upload, to retrieve the URL
    to the hosted image (just like WebService::Images::Nofrag).
